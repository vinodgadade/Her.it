                                    <h2>Challenges of so called Modern Education</h2>
                                    <h5>Title description, Jan, 2020</h5>
                                    <div class="fakeimg">
                                    <img src="assets/images/blogs/sanjay-blog-1.jpg" style="max-width: 100%; max-height: 100%;" class="blog-img" /></div>

                                      The stillness of mind that calms down the perturbing vibrations of any sort of anxiety, remorse, frustration or fear is the first step into the vast kingdom of meditative happiness. And mind you, this meditation generated happiness is not a copyright property of any religion— it is the most primordial and innate belonging of human race.
                                    </p><br>
                                    When I closely examine my peers and also my younger generations I am forced to think about the education that they have had during their infancy and later years. And by education I wish to underline the life negotiating skills also. It is so because in the ultimate analysis it is only life negotiating skills that navigate your life. If a brilliant mind and a proven performer named Sushant Singh is led to commit suicide in the face of professional hardships then one must ask this question— what education did Sushant receive during his formative years?

                                    The moment a youth enters the complicated world of professionally competitive market, s/he is required to be equipped with capabilities of resilience, withstanding all types of tensions, dealing with unexpected adverse situations, deceits from all directions and what not. All this perplexes the young chap beyond comprehension. And then s/he realizes that the skill to negotiate these situations has to be learnt afresh and with lightening speed.
                                    
                                    Most of the families and the majority of the schools, whether governmental or English medium public schools, are failing to instill independence of thought, forthrightness, fearless thinking, large heartedness, compassion, selfless friendship, patience, the ability of facing vicissitudes of life with magnanimity, absolute confidence etc. These are some of the attributes that form the basis of a solid character that can face the ups and down of life bravely, without ever giving in to the unpredictable but inevitable circumstantial periodic curve of success and failure.  
                                    
                                    So, my question to the reader is, can you remember to have visited an educational institution that imparts practical training to its pupils to maintain mental cool while the situations are antagonistic, harsh and not favourable. How many families have you visited where the younger members of the family have the scope of having an undeclared but continuously happening circumstantial training of responding gracefully to failures and building resilience within.
                                    
                                    To remain uninfluenced by the onslaught of the cacophony of all that is termed ‘modern’ and ‘fashionable’ and ‘in’ requires a kind of self confidence that is based on ‘what you are’ rather than ‘how you look’.  To be able to see through the difference between necessity and luxury requires, again, the power of observation and introspection based on some timeless, or, you can say, time tested, values of life.
                                    
                                    The prevalent competition driven education system and the ever growing nuclear family system under the suffocating influence of capitalist world order are putting an intangible pressure on both the conscious and subconscious mind of societies and their members. The challenge to negotiate this pressure and emerge a winner through the labyrinthine path of life requires an altogether different kind of vibrancy, resilience and openness in our education system and family ethos.
                                    
                                    The NEP 2020 raises hope of rejuvenating the education system in its entirety – from pre primary to university education— but the other aspect of value inculcation within familial atmosphere is still lagging far behind. It is high time we, as society and individually, too, rise to the challenge and start acting with strategies rooted in humane, unorthodox, sensible, futuristic wisdom. And one last thing— the traditional Indian wisdom regarding life values and education is far more encompassing, holistic and just than a lot of so called modern-most consumerist education systems. Hence a futuristic synergy is the call of the hour.
